# Linear Regression Analysis Repository

Welcome to the Linear Regression Analysis repository! This project is a dedicated space for exploring and implementing Linear Regression models. 

## Introduction

Linear Regression is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning, widely used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. This repository consolidates my work on linear regression analysis, providing clear implementations and explanatory documentation.

## Models Included

The repository includes the following linear regression models:

- **Simple Linear Regression:** A basic model with a single predictor variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extending simple linear regression to multiple predictor variables.

Each model is implemented with clarity and accompanied by relevant documentation.
